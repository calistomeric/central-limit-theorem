# central-limit-theorem
This proves the central limit theorem using python.
Central Limit Theorem postulates that samples randomly selected from a population irrespective of it's distribution will have a normal distribution.
The average of the mean of the sample (xbar) is approximately equal to the mean of the population (sigma).
The std of the sample is approximately equal to the population std divided by the square root of the number of items present in a sample.
However, the attached code has std of sample approximately equal to std of population which is due to the small number of population available.
